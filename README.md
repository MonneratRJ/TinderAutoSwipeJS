# TinderAutoSwipeJS
A really simple script to auto swipe right on profiles on Tinder...

No need to install anything, just open Tinder on your browser, open dev tools and insert the lines in the "script.js" following instructions...

First find the aria-label of the desired button you want to press, then insert in the first line where we declare the button.

Second, run the second line, that starts the loop on a variable called "loop" so it will start auto-swiping right...

Third but last, after you finished you can use the last line to clear the interval (loop) wich will stop the auto-swiping.
